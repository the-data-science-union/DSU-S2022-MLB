# DSU-S2022-MLB

Welcome to the DSU Summer 2022 MLB Playoffs Project GitHub! This project uses Python to 
gather data, conduct EDA, and  use machine learning to analyze and predict the playoff status 
of Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. All data used for this project was gathered from 
Baseball Reference (Baseball-Reference.com) and it belongs to them. Analysis was broken up 
into analyzing hitting, pitching, and fielding metrics. [Here is the link](https://medium.com/@ucladsu/predicting-mlb-playoff-teams-from-their-yearly-statistics-2fc058f163af) to the article that discusses the project and findings.
